## some thoughts

autodidacticism is a wonderful practice, because your curriculum is unbounded and your speed is self-determined.

for those who build: curiosity, kindness, and the ability to seriously lock in are the most important skills.

working hard is hard. working hard on the right thing is so much harder. this is not just because it requires clear vantage over the problem space, but because it requires judgement. that judgement is <ins>taste</ins>.

the world is quite malleable.

it's so easy to get caught up in speed and execution. slow, calm reflection, and the meta-analysis of your own thoughts is an enormously useful skill.
